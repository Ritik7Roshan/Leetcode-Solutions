**low<mid<high**
our intension is that make**low smaller as can possible**
make mid smaller as can possible but it should be greater than low
if we found any element greater than mid than we get triplet
1.Traverse whole array
2.if nums[i] <low means we can update low bcz we found new low .
3.if nums[i] >low && nums[i]<mid it will be new mid
4.if nums[i] >mid it means nums[i] is largest than mid and it is als greater than low
so we get nums[i] as high so return true
